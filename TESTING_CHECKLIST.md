# Google Authentication Testing Checklist

## ✅ Prerequisites Completed
- [x] Database setup script created (`complete-database-setup.sql`)
- [x] Development server running on `http://localhost:5173`
- [x] Google OAuth code implemented in AuthContext and AuthModal
- [x] Supabase configuration ready

## 🚀 Final Steps to Complete

### Step 1: Run Database Setup
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select project: `xnlsijpognudxyoswajm`
3. Open `SQL Editor` → `New Query`
4. Copy entire content from `complete-database-setup.sql`
5. Paste and click `Run`

### Step 2: Verify Database Setup
After running the script, verify you see:
- ✅ "Tables created successfully"
- ✅ "3" (product count)
- ✅ "Database setup completed successfully!"

### Step 3: Test Google Authentication
1. **Open your app**: `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Click "Sign In"** in the navigation
3. **Click "Continue with Google"**
4. **Complete Google OAuth flow**
5. **Should redirect back successfully**

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- User is redirected to Google OAuth
- After Google login, user returns to your app
- User profile is automatically created
- User can access all app features
- No more "Database error saving new user"

### ❌ If Still Having Issues:
1. **Check Supabase Logs**
   - Go to `Logs` in Supabase dashboard
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify Tables Exist**
   - Go to `Table Editor` in Supabase
   - Should see: `user_profiles`, `products`, `cart_items`, `orders`, `order_items`

3. **Check RLS Policies**
   - Go to `Authentication` → `Policies`
   - Verify policies are enabled

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### If Google OAuth Still Not Working:
1. **Check Google OAuth Configuration**

   - Ensure it's enabled
   - Verify Client ID and Secret are set

2. **Check Site URL**
   - Go to `Authentication` → `URL Configuration`
   - Set `Site URL` to: `http://localhost:5173`
   - Add `http://localhost:5173` to `Redirect URLs`

### If Database Errors Persist:
1. **Re-run the setup script**
2. **Check for any error messages in SQL Editor**
3. **Verify all tables were created successfully**

## 🎉 Success!
