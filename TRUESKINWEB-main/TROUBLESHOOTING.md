# 🔧 Troubleshooting Blank Page Issue

## ✅ Server Status
Your development server is running successfully on: **http://localhost:5174/**

## 🧪 Debug Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for any errors:
- Go to `http://localhost:5174/`
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Click on the "Console" tab
- Look for any red error messages

### 2. **Verify the Page Loads**
- Make sure you're visiting: `http://localhost:5174/` (not 5173)
- Try refreshing the page (Ctrl+F5)
- Check if the page title shows "TrueSkin - Your Skin's Overnight Miracle"

### 3. **Check Network Tab**
- In Developer Tools, go to "Network" tab
- Refresh the page
- Look for any failed requests (red entries)
- Check if all files are loading successfully

### 4. **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### Issue: Blank white page
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Issue: "Cannot resolve module" errors
**Solution**: The React Query package might not be installed properly
```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

#### Issue: CSS not loading
**Solution**: Check if Tailwind CSS is working by inspecting elements

#### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution**: Verify images exist in `public/images/` directory

## 🎯 Quick Test

Try visiting these URLs to isolate the issue:
1. `http://localhost:5174/` - Home page
2. `http://localhost:5174/shop` - Shop page
3. `http://localhost:5174/about` - About page

## 📞 What to Check

If you're still seeing a blank page, please check:

1. **Browser Console Errors** - Any red error messages?

3. **Page Source** - Right-click → "View Page Source" - does it show HTML?
4. **URL** - Are you visiting the correct localhost:5174 URL?
