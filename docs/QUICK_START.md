## 📁 Required Images

Make sure these images exist in your `public/images/` directory:

```
public/images/
├── p4.png               # Heal Pack image
├── p8.png               # Fresh Pack image  
├── p12.png              # Glow Pack image
├── prd.jpg              # Product image
├── tsp.jpg              # Product image
└── placeholder.jpg      # Fallback image (optional)
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Optimizations

### 1. **Visit the Shop Page**
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/shop`
- You should see the skeleton loader first
- Then products load with local images

### 2. **Test Caching**
- Navigate to another page and back
- Products should load instantly from cache
- Refresh the page - should still be fast

### 3. **Test Error Handling**
- Disconnect internet and try to load products
- Should show error message with retry button

## 🔧 Database Optimization (Optional)

For maximum performance, run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of performance-indexes.sql
-- This adds database indexes for faster queries
```
